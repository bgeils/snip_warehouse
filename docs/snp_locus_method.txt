This is the process I used:

0. Download your file from 23andme.

1. Download dbSNP from NCBI at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/.
You only need database/shared_data/SnpFunctionCode.bcp.gz
and database/organisms/human_9606/database/organism_data/b132_SNPContigLocusId_37_1.bcp.gz
.

2. Read the explanation of SNPContigLocusId at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_db_table_description.cgi?t=SNPContigLocusId

3. Build a database from b132_SNPContigLocusId_37_1.bcp.
Save snp_id, locus_symbol (gene name when in a gene), protein_acc,
fxn_class, allele.
Index by snp_id.

4. Download OMIM from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/repository/OMIM/ARCHIVE/ .

5. Build a DB from OMIM/ARCHIVE/genebank and omim.txt.
Read dominance info from omim.txt.
Read other info from genebank.
Read genebank.key for description.
Save locus, gene, and disorder.
(Join the 3 disorder fields together, throwing out fields that are
just a space.)
Parse the gene field into individual gene symbols.

6. Parse your 23andme file.
For each rs# in the file, strip off the 'rs' and look up the number in
your SNPContigLocusId db.
Retrieve the locus_symbol, allele, and fxn_class.
If fxn_class is in the range 41-44 (bad mutations that destroy the protein),
look up the locus_symbol in omim.
If you find it, retrieve the associated dominance and disorder.
Check the genotype from your 23andme data against
the allele of the SNP and the dominance info (if any).
If it is possible for the individual to have a disease caused by this
mutation, print out the SNP info, including disease;
and add the associated diseases to your list of possible diseases.
